# Multi-Threaded-Hangman-Client

Me and a classmate coded a Hangman game to guess a word in three categories: US States, Pets, and Colors. This is the server part of the project. This code is built as the client side of the project that establishes connection with the server side. The client code serves as the user interface for clients. All user input is communicated with the server. The server will respond back and the client code will decide how to handle different responses from the server and what to display to the user.
